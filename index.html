                <p>
                    DeTect is the world leader in advanced bird radar technologies for real-time aircraft birdstrike avoidance, wind energy bird and bat mortality risk mitigation, and industrial bird control with over 140 of its MERLIN bird radars installed in the US, Canada, Europe, Africa and Asia. The Company's RAPTOR Radar Wind Profiler is the most advanced wind measurement radar available and was selected by the US National Weather Service for upgrade of the US Next Generation National Profiler Network and by NASA Kennedy Space Center Florida for rocket launch support. In 2012 DeTect deployed the first radar-activated windfarm turbine obstruction lighting system in the US - a HARRIER Visual Warning System - that provides automated activation of wind turbine obstruction lights when aircraft are detected within ten miles of the wind farm. DeTect's HARRIER Drone Surveillance Radar (DSR), based on its MERLIN technology, is the most sensitive and advanced system available for detection, tracking and interdiction of drones and small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

                    DeTect radar systems are in use at facilities and projects worldwide with a proven record of exceptional performance, reliability and operability and over five million hours of successful operating experience on systems operating since 2003. The US Air Force has purchased seven MERLIN systems to date based on a documented record of improved aircrew safety, reducing aircraft-birdstrike damage and increasing mission readiness. NASA, after evaluation and on-site testing of various bird radar technologies, selected DeTect's MERLIN system to support space launch safety for the $2 billion space shuttle for 22 launches from 2006 to the end of the program in 2011 with 100% system uptime.
